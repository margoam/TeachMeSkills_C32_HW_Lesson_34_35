The following is implemented:
1. Create triggers that will write data to the logs table when updating/deleting users in the database.
2. Create a function that will return the login of the last registered user in the database.
3. Create a database schema for a small library management system. Include the following tables:
Books (id, title, author, year of publication)
Readers (id, name, email)
Reservations (id, book_id, reader_id, booking_date, return_date)
4. Connect Flyway to manage table migrations from the previous homework (Library Management System).
